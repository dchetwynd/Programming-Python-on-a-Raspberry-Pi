This is a talk that I gave at the Python Sheffield user group on 26/06/2012. The Python Sheffield user group meets on the final Tuesday of each month at the GIST Lab and is open to all levels of Python user, including those who don't currently know the Python language, but would like to learn. To find out more, follow @pysheff on Twitter or see the Google group http://groups.google.com/group/python-sheffield
